          &emsp;&emsp;My name is Samuel ÄŽurkovic. I'm a dedicated programmer with a passion for design.
          While my academic background is in the field of robotics and cybernetics, I find joy
          in channeling my creativity into crafting unique UIs and designs.
        </p>
        
        <p className={paragraph}>
          &emsp;&emsp;As a programmer, I appreciate the power of logical thinking and problem-solving.
          This background complements my design work, allowing me to bring a structured and
          technical approach to my poster creations. It's the fusion of art and technology
          that inspires me and makes each project unique.
